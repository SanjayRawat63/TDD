                                Test Driven Development
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that focuses on creating unit
test cases before developing the actual code. It is an iterative approach that combines 
programming, the creation of unit tests, and refactoring.
The Process of using TDD is often described as Red/Green/Refractor.
